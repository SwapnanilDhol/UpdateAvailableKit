# UpdateAvailableKit
This is UpdateAvailableKit: a super easy way to check if the installed app has an update available. It is built with simplicity and customisability in mind and comes with pre-written tests.

## Installation 
`UpdateAvailableKit` is available via [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/). To add `UpdateAvailableKit` simply add this repoâ€™s URL to your projectâ€™s package file. You can choose to use one of the stable releases (tagged) or you can point your package file to the main branch of this project. Although, I would not merge broken code into the `main` branch, if you prefer stability, itâ€™s recommended to use a tagged version.

## Usage
`UpdateAvailableKit` operates using a singleton class named `UpdateAvailableManager`. This class contains two publicly exposed methods. The important driver is this method:

```swift
public func checkForVersionUpdate(
    with bundleID: String = Bundle.main.bundleIdentifier,
    currentVersion: String = Bundle.main.releaseVersionNumber,
    useCache: Bool = true,
    completion: @escaping((Result<UpdateAvailableResult, Error>) -> Void)
)
```

`checkForVersionUpdate` is self describing. It checks the current version thatâ€™s installed on the device and compares it to the version thatâ€™s live on the AppStore. It returns a Swift Result where Success is `UpdateAvailableResult` and failure is a generic `Error` for now.

The function accepts a few parameters. Most of them have a default value attached to them but can be overridden when necessary.
* `bundleID`: Pass a Bundle Identifier here. It defaults to your targetâ€™s `Bundle.main.bundleIdentifer` value.
* `currentVersion`: Pass the current version of your app in a `String` format (XX.XX.XX). This, again, defaults to the current version of the app using values from `Bundle.main`.
* `useCache`: Flag to decide if the completion handler returns values from a cached response or a newly fetched result from iTunes. More about Caching in `UpdateAvailableKit` towards the end of this file.

Use it in your projects like this

```swift
UpdateAvailableManager.shared.checkForVersionUpdate { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let result):
        switch result {
        case .updateAvailable(let newVersion):
            print("Update Available. New Verison is \(newVersion)")
        case .noUpdatesAvailable:
            print("No updates available")
        }
    case .failure(let error):
        print("Error did Occur. Error was \(error)")
    }
}
```

### UpdateAvailableResult
`UpdateAvailableResult` is an enum conforming to `Equtable` with two cases: 

```swift
case updateAvailable(newVersion: String)
```
This case will be returned by the `checkForVersionUpdate` methodâ€™s completion handler when thereâ€™s a new version available. The associated value is the latest AppStore version in `String` type.

```swift
case noUpdatesAvailable
```
This case will be returned when the current installed version is equal to or greater than the AppStore version.

## Async Alternative
`UpdateAvailableKit` support Swift's new [concurrency](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Concurrency.html) features.
If youâ€™re using iOS 15 and above, you can choose to use the `async` `await` alternative. Thanks to [Rudrank Riyam](https://github.com/rudrankriyam) for this contribution.

```swift
switch try await UpdateAvailableManager.shared.checkForVersionUpdate() {
case .updateAvailable(let newVersion):
    print("New Version is available. \(newVersion)")
case .noUpdatesAvailable:
    print("No updates available")
}
```

## Caching
To fetch the current AppStore version, `UpdateAvailableKit` performs a GET request to the ITunesLookup end point. The URL is
`https://itunes.apple.com/lookup?bundleID=yourBundleID`.\
The response is then cached for 3600 seconds so as to not make repeated calls to the API and to trigger the completion super fast.ðŸš€ The response is encoded and stored in `UserDefaults`. No external cache solution is used. In the future, Iâ€™d like to move it to a solution based on SwiftCache.
